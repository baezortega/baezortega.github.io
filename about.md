I'm Adrian Baez-Ortega, a (bio)informatician and a doctoral student in the [Transmissible Cancer Group](https://www.tcg.vet.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, UK. 

My PhD research is on the long-term evolution of an 11,000-year-old [contagious cancer](https://www.tcg.vet.cam.ac.uk/about) in dogs, and my major academic interests are in understanding the influence of forces of mutation and selection on the genomes of normal and cancer cells. My side interests include evolutionary genetics, statistics, physics, astronomy and music.

I also like writing scientific dissemination articles for my (other) blog, 
[divulgatum](http://www.divulgatum.com).
