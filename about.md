### Adrian Baez-Ortega

I'm a (bio)informatician and a doctoral student at the Transmissible Cancer Group, University of 
Cambridge. My PhD revolves around the evolution of an 11,000-year-old contagious cancer in dogs. 
My major academic interests are in understanding the influence of forces of mutation and selection on normal and 
neoplastic genomes; side interests include evolutionary genetics, statistics, physics, astronomy and music.

I also like writing scientific dissemination articles for my (other) blog, 
[divulgatum](www.divulgatum.com).
