### Adrian Baez-Ortega

I'm a (bio)informatician and a doctoral student at the [Transmissible Cancer Group](https://www.tcg.vet.cam.ac.uk/), 
University of Cambridge. My PhD investigates the long-term genomic evolution of an 11,000-year-old contagious cancer in dogs. 
My major academic interests are in understanding the influence of forces of mutation and selection on normal and 
neoplastic genomes; side interests include evolutionary genetics, statistics, physics, astronomy and music.

I also like writing scientific dissemination articles for my (other) blog, 
[divulgatum](http://www.divulgatum.com).
